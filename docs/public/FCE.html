        <p>The course <span class="fce">"Fundamentals of Computer Engineering"</span> provides a comprehensive exploration of the historical
        evolution and core components of computer technology. Beginning with a journey through technological milestones
        such as punched cards, early computers, transistors, and the advent of the internet, the course establishes a
        foundational understanding of the field's historical context.</p>

        <p>Moving on, the curriculum delves into the intricate relationship between hardware and software, offering
        in-depth insights into the underlying principles that govern computer systems. Students gain proficiency in
        understanding and manipulating various number bases, including decimal, binary, hexadecimal, and floating point
        representations, crucial for effective computation and programming.</p>

        <p>The course extends its focus to contemporary and cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence
        and quantum computing. By exploring these advanced topics, students grasp the transformative potential of
        emerging technologies and their impact on the future of computer engineering.</p>

        <p>The final segment of the course shifts towards practical applications, specifically web development. Students
        acquire hands-on experience with HTML and CSS, delving into the building blocks of web pages and understanding
        the fundamentals of front-end development. The integration of a practical exercise, requiring the creation of a
        webpage using HTML and CSS, ensures that theoretical knowledge translates into tangible skills.</p>

        <p>In summary, <span class="fce">"Fundamentals of Computer Engineering"</span> equips students with a holistic understanding of the
        historical evolution, core principles, and practical applications within the realm of computer engineering,
        fostering a well-rounded skill set essential for navigating the dynamic landscape of technology.</p>
