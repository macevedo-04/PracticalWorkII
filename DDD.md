# PracticalWorkII

Description:
This webpage is about myself and my degree, as well as a topic we discussed in class. The index has fragments of all the sections inside the webpage, which are an about me page, a contact me form, a page about the topic, a page with information about my degree, and a page which conects to my partners' pages. Each one of these pages is an individual html file, and all of them are connected to tthe dame css file. 

Problems: 
In my case, I felt it a bit confusing to work with all the styles in the same css file. I would have preferred having a css file for each html file, but in the end I have been able to manage. 
Other problems I had were with the alignments of the element in several pages, so I had to make numerous minor changes to be able to center all the contents of the page. 
I really had dificulites with the net page, since I wanted to put a slider, but sometimes it bugs. Hope it's not too critical for the work.

Conclusions:
In my case, I had already worked with html and css before, but this work has helped me get more into the details, which was quite fun. 
Also, I have sometimes underestimated web developing, so this activity has been really helpful to make me realise it is actually quite complicated.
